# Express-Note-Taker
UConn Bootcamp Chapter 11 Express Challenge

## Description
In this chapter 11 challenge, I took my knowledge of Express.js and used it to create an Express Note-Taker.  I now have a valuable asset to use in my journey toward becoming a web developer as I can use this Note-Taker for projects or as a part of my coding portfolio.


## Process
* The first thing I did after creating the repository was add in empty base files like my HTML files, CSS, and package.json.

* The next step was to install the necessary dependencies for my app, as well as set up my server.js with a GET request handler and a wildcard route.

* Next, I wrote out my fsUtils functions: readFromFile, writeToFile, and readAndAppend.  These were necessary for correctly transferring over data.

* Finally, through various commits and pushes, I wrote out my GET, POST, and DELETE routes for getting, posting, and deleting notes by their ID.  These endpoints added closure to the app as data now had a place to go.

## Conclusion
Overall, this was a very useful and fun project to work on.  I enjoyed practicing my routing and using Express was very interesting to me.  It was difficult for me to get some of the routings originally, but with some help from a tutor, I was able to figure it out in the end.
